A rear lens cap for any ARRI S mount lens.

Tonight I ran across a place selling rear lens caps for lenses with this mount for $80 USD (!!!) so I figured I'd better make one myself to share with people that may be looking for one. It's a tight fight but after pulling on an off a few times it'll be just perfect.

Instructions
--------
I printed with HIPS filament on the following settings, and results were great

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 1.05
* Fill: 20

I suppose if you're concerned about the aesthetics you could use 0.1 layers but to my eye it really wasn't enough a difference to justify the print time.
